# axon-shell

The native shell around the `clients/web` bundle (ADR 0102, M-W12). Desktop
today; iOS and Android are M-W13.

## Build it through the Tauri CLI, not cargo

```sh
cd clients/web
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev     # dev loop, hot reload
pnpm tauri build   # release binary + installers
```

**`cargo build` / `cargo run` in this directory produce a binary that launches
and shows nothing but an error.** That is not a broken checkout. The frontend is
embedded at compile time from `../dist`, which is generated and gitignored, so
a fresh clone has none — and `tauri::generate_context!()` says nothing about it.
The CLI is what runs the frontend build first (`beforeBuildCommand`); cargo on
its own has no idea it needs to. The binary explains this if you hit it.

## Its own cargo workspace

Not a member of the repo root's. `cross-build.yml` runs `cargo build
--workspace` on three platforms and the pre-push gate runs `cargo clippy
--all-targets`; membership would have put webkit2gtk and a desktop app build on
every one of them. The root `Cargo.toml` names this directory in `exclude` so
cargo treats it as deliberate rather than an unlisted member.

The pre-push gate covers it separately, as `shell-fmt`, `shell-clippy` and
`shell-test`, filtered to this directory.

## Linux build dependencies

```sh
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential curl wget file \
  libxdo-dev libssl-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
```

Only needed if you actually touch this crate; nothing else in the repo links
against them.

## The dev server port is pinned

`beforeDevCommand` is `pnpm dev --strictPort`, so it fails if 5173 is taken
rather than drifting to 5174. `devUrl` in `tauri.conf.json` names 5173, and
Vite's default of quietly picking another port means the shell would otherwise
load whatever _else_ is on 5173 — a different app, with no error anywhere.

## Icons

`icons/` is generated from `icon-source.png` (rasterised from
`../public/favicon.svg` at 1024×1024):

```sh
pnpm exec tauri icon src-tauri/icon-source.png -o src-tauri/icons
```

## The bundle identifier is provisional

`org.matrixaxon.axon`. It becomes a permanent store identity and cannot be
changed later without shipping a new app, so settle it before any submission.
